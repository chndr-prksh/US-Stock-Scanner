US Stock Scanner 📊🇺🇸

A Python-based US stock market scanner that computes technical indicators for thousands of US-listed stocks (NYSE, NASDAQ) and automatically publishes the results to Google Sheets for easy filtering, discovery, and analysis.

Built for traders, investors, and analysts who want a scalable, automated technical screening system with a simple spreadsheet-based interface.

🧠 How the Scanner Works
	1.	Pulls historical OHLCV data for US stocks
	2.	Cleans and normalizes the data using Pandas
	3.	Computes technical indicators via Python TA libraries
	4.	Aggregates results into a structured table
	5.	Pushes the output to Google Sheets using the Sheets API
	6.	Google Sheets acts as a live technical scanner dashboard

📊 Google Sheets as the UI Layer

Google Sheets is used as the front-end for:
	•	Filtering stocks by RSI, trend, volatility, etc.
	•	Sorting by indicator values or signal strength
	•	Creating custom watchlists
	•	Applying conditional formatting
	•	Sharing scans with collaborators

This approach keeps the system powerful yet accessible to non-technical users.
